# Hello, I'm Arthur Cruz
I'm a fullstack Solutions Architect / Senior Software Engineer who loves computer science and frontend, backend, mobile and devops related technologies, specially backend programming languages and frameworks. I work mostly with Java, VueJS and Flutter, but recently I'm very interested in Rust and getting used with React and Typescript.
