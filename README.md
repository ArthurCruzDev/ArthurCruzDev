# Hello, I'm Arthur Cruz
I'm a fullstack Solutions Architect / Senior Software Engineer who loves computer science, frontend, backend, mobile and devops related technologies, specially backend programming languages and frameworks. I worked mostly with Java, Spring Boot, Vue.js, React and Flutter, but recently I'm very interested in Rust and SolidJs.
